/* 
EXPRESS
is a node framwork allowing routing to be made easier
CORS
is a package in node which allows our frontend to interact with the backend
basically the frontend will be on a different server than the backend which will not work
if we want them to work together so we are using cors to enable cross origin ressource sharing
possible.
So two appilcations that share a different origin can interact with each other thanks
to Cors
BODYPARSER
If we want to haondle POST requests from USERS we want to have a bodyparser
it extracts the entire body of the request
so we can use request.body easily to get the information for our backend
MONGOOSE
enables use to interact with a mongodb database more easily
we can define models and interact with those models in our backend code
